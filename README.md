## Hello everyone! This is my second app, made right after the [I am Rich app](https://github.com/vcolen/I-am-Rich-app), to better fixate the concepts I learned during this lesson, which were:
- How to set up a new Xcode project.
- How to use the Interface Builder to design and create the appearance of your app.
- How to find your way around Xcode.
- How to size and arrange various UI elements.
- How to add custom image assets to Xcode projects.
- How to create app icons and size them for all resolutions. How to run apps on the iOS Simulator as well as sideload to a physical device.

## This is a project from the iOS development bootcamp, taught by Angela Yu :)
